<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project for the r-ArgentinaPrograma course, the objective was to fetch data from the PokeAPI to retrieve information about all the available pokemons. The task was to display twenty pokemons at a time, using a navigation system to move between different pages.

The project aimed to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the list of pokemons and find the one they are looking for. In addition to displaying name and image about each pokemon, the interface also provides the option to view detailed information for a particular pokemon.

To implement this project, I made use of various web development technologies, including HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and then tested it with Cypress framework. The project's frontend was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a simple and clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for.
